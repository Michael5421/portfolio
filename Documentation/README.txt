----------------------------------------------------------UPDATE v1.12---------------------------------------------------------

In this update, I have added a navigation bar at the top of the page, which links to 5 different pages at the moment. I have also added a search bar (currently non-functional) and

have made the website in dark mode for easier viewing. I am currently working on creating navigation tabs for more in-depth navigation, as well as adding graphics, possibly with

clickable elements. I have also implemented a table for one of my pages, but may remove in the future for aesthetic reasons. The code for the side-navigation tabs is commented out,

but what I have completed so far is there if you would like to take a look.

----------------------------------------------------------UPDATE v1.52---------------------------------------------------------

In this update, I have reverted the website to light mode, as it faired better with the customization I was using. I also have lessened the number of pages needed to view all of my

information, as it was not as efficient to navigate to various pages for so little information. I have also changed the body font and am currently working on a information sorting

method for my About Me page that will display the information nicely. I am also currently working on adding graphics to my site, but I am trying to decide on what graphics will be

appropriate for my portfolio site other than a picture of myself. In the next update, I hope to have the information sorted, graphics added, the search bar replaced with a download

resume button, and the placeholder banner for my site removed and my profile picture added in its place on the top left corner.

----------------------------------------------------------UPDATE v1.89---------------------------------------------------------

In this update, I have removed the search bar, as it was not needed in the kind of site I am going for. I have replaced it with a resume download button, as well as added my profile

picture in the top right corner of my website. I have added graphics where I deemed them necessary, and have sorted the information to be more readable and presentable. While my

projects tab is still being worked on, as I don't have any projects to present other than this one I am currently working on, I will update it in the future if I begin to work on

more projects. For improvements, I may change the alignment of some site elements, as well as change the graphics if I find better ones/deem them unnecessary.

----------------------------------------------------------Initial vs Midterm Comparison---------------------------------------------------------

From my initial design document, I have changed my website a lot in order to optimize the ease of use, as well as make it visually appealing. I have cut down the amount of pages

that my website contains, as many could be combined for easier viewing and navigation, and features such as making the resume downloadable and printable in the same clickable

for more choice to the person viewing it. I believe that my site is more visually appealing now that what I initially thought it out to be. As for weekly updates, you can view

the above notes to see what I changed from assignment-to-assignment. It went through many iterations, which can be seen through my previous submissions.
